#GAC
This is a toolkit for unity to customize characters based on a base mesh at runtime programaticly via bone scaling. It also supports hotswapping items like clothing and weapons that if made correctly will automatically scale to fit the modified character.

This is not super well documented and there is not a lot of sample assets but it pretty much works.

The repo is [here](https://github.com/richardkopelow/GAC).
